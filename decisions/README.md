About the problem (Descisions)

the return value should be the number of letters deleted from string
 
to obtain the String good. us remove the letter(s) want was have the same
caracter, where this characters should not be both uniques.
 It need be duples, triples..., if is unique in both, So remove any one.
   The final result, we return the correspondent value of characters removed.

"abbcca" = "here we can remove, only one this letters, and the result is pos-
sibly three types; 1: abbcc, 2: bccaa, 3: cbbaa"
  the return for this function is 1, for any this three values possible at use
of function.
